						<div class="content">
							<p> This is a video showcase of my passion project, - Stock Analytica. Stock Analytica is a proprietary tool that web scrapes any publicly traded company's financial statements to gather key data and create important statistics or visualizations that are commonly looked at by CFAs. I also apply my own statistical spin to help valuate stocks. All of the data is webscraped from YahooFinance, MarketWatch, MacroTrends, or the SEC.</p>

							<h2>Home</h2>

						<div class="content">
							<p> This is the Home page. It is the first thing one looks at when booting up Stock Analytica. It contains a given stock's 20 year price history. Followed underneath by a description of the company's bussiness functions. Followed by important and/or interesting statistics such as the trailing PE ratio. You may have noticed that there's an input bar at the top right corner, there you can enter any ticker symbol to gather all neccessary data to generate insights. Finally, all charts are interactive where you can hover any data point and zoom in!</p>

										<h2>Statistical Spin</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="content">
										<p>Stock Analytica creates, under the tabs: Dividend Charts, Valuation Ratio Charts, Macro Economic Charts, & Insider Trading Chart, unique statistics & visualizations that I myself find interesting that may not be coming with other investors.
											In the Dividend Charts tab, you'll see graphs that solely have to do with a firm's dividend such as its: Divdiend History, Trailing Divdiends, Dividend % change (year over year), Yield History, & Payout Ratios.
											In the Valuation Ratio Charts you'll see the empirical distribution of EPS % surprise, essentially how far off the actual EPS reported was to the Analysts' expected EPS. From there the data is Bootstrapped in order 
											to create a Mean Gaussian Distribution of the EPS in aggreement to the Central Limit Theorem, this is achieved by random resampling numerous times and calculating the mean EPS % surprise to create said Mean Gaussian distribution.
											Once the Mean Gaussian Distribution is created, a 95% confidence interval is constructed where the lower bound is treated as pessimistic correction to the analysts' upcoming EPS expectation and the upper bound is treated as the optimistic correction.
											A Shapiro's Wilk Test is conducted to prove Normality of the Bootstrapped Distribution. The Boxplot and 5-Number Summary display the PE ratio through out 20yrs agains the corrected PE ratios & Trailing PE ratio.
											In the Macro Economic Charts tabs, there are Pearson & Spearman Correlations between the Stock's price movements against its EPS, FED Balance Sheet, US GDP, or the SP500 price movements.
											In the Insider Trading Chart tab, there's a timeseries of the buys and sells done by higher ups in a firm, data gathered by openinsider.com.
